- # Weather App of Runeterra
  After building a simple weather widget, I decided to spice it up and assign some Runeterra's regions to different cities on Earth.

- ## How It's Made:
    
  **Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    
  As I was playing and learning more about APIs, I decided to build a weather app widget using the free OpenWeather API. As soon as I finished this project, I decided to assign one city to each regions of Runeterra. For example, Noxus is assigned to Moscow, so you if are asking the weather of Noxus, you actualy get the one from Moscow. Nothing complicated. I just felt I had to personalize this project a bit.
  I decided to add a map of Runeterra and use the map/area tags in HTML. In combinasion with the onclick tag element, I was able to add click events directly to the map.

- ## Optimizations:
  
  If I had more time to work on it I would use some sound of rain/snow when needed, to match the current weather of the city. I would rework the UI to make match the League of Legends universe, and also add the images of the different regions in the weather section. I would also refactor my code and find a way to not repeat 10 times the exact same function.

- ## Lessons Learned:
    
  MAP and AREA tags are pretty cool. onclick="myFunction()" is really practical.
